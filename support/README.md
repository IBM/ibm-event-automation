# Must Gather Support Tool

This directory hosts the tooling you should use for collecting diagnostic information
to supply to IBM when opening an IBM support case for one of the IBM Event Automation capabilities.

The `ibm-events-must-gather` script can be used to collect diagnostic information for all
the IBM Event Automation capabilities either individually or collectively depending on the
parameters specified when running the script.

For information on running the script see the [gathering logs documentation.](https://ibm.biz/ea-gather-logs)
