# IBM Event Automation Samples and Tools

This repository is used to host additional samples and diagnostic tools for the different
capabilities that are part of IBM Event Automation.  The content in this repository will evolve
over time and whilst there are directories for each capability, the support directory contains
the single mustgather collection tool for all the different capabilities.
